# ritsecctf-2025

This is a repo for storing the challenges I made for RITsec CTF 2025.

# Challenges
## Hashmatch
Hashmatch is a PWN challenge where you have to build a ROP chain that constructs your command with prng before running it.
## Upload Issues
Upload Issues is a misc challenge where you exploit directory traversal in cpio.
## Upload Issues 2
Upload Issues 2 is a clone of Upload Issues, but instead of cpio you exploit directory traversal via symlinks in busybox tar.
