# ritsecctf-2025

This is a repo for storing the challenges I made for RITsec CTF 2025.

# Challenges
## Hashmatch
Hashmatch is a PWN challenge where you have to build a ROP chain that constructs your command before running it.
## Upload Issues
Upload Issues is a misc challenge where you exploit a vuln in the cpio implementation of old busybox.
